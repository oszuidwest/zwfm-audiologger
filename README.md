# Audiologger ZuidWest FM

This repository contains a bash script designed to record audio streams hourly and log relevant metadata about the current broadcast. It also ensures the periodic cleanup of old recordings.

## Features

- **Continuous Recording**: Automatically captures the audio stream from ZuidWest FM every hour.
- **Metadata Logging**: Fetches and logs the current program name from the broadcast data API, adding context to each recording.
- **Detailed Log File**: Maintains a comprehensive log file for tracking the scriptâ€™s activities and any potential errors.
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Deletes audio files older than 31 days to conserve storage space.
- **Debug Mode**: Provides additional output for troubleshooting when enabled.

## Prerequisites

The script requires the following tools:
- `jq` - A command-line JSON processor.
- `curl` - A command-line tool for transferring data with URLs.
- `ffmpeg` - A command-line tool for recording, converting, and streaming audio and video.

This script is intended for use with websites based on the [Streekomroep WordPress Theme](https://github.com/oszuidwest/streekomroep-wp), which utilizes the Broadcast Data API from the theme. If you are using a different API, set `PARSE_METADATA` to 0 and use a plaintext file for metadata, or implement your own parsing method.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oszuidwest/zwfm-audiologger
   cd zwfm-audiologger
   ```
2. **Ensure the script is executable:**
   ```
   chmod +x audiologger.sh
   ```

## Configuration

Edit the script to specify the recording directory (`RECDIR`), log file path (`LOGFILE`), and other parameters:
- `STREAMURL`: The URL of the audio stream.
- `RECDIR`: The directory where audio recordings are stored.
- `LOGFILE`: The path to the log file for logging script operations.
- `METADATA_URL`: The API endpoint for fetching broadcast metadata.
- `KEEP`: The number of days to retain audio recordings.
- `PARSE_METADATA`: Enables or disables metadata parsing from the Streekomroep WordPress theme.

## Usage

Schedule the script to run every hour using cron:
1. Open your crontab:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
2. Add the following line to run the script at the start of every hour:
   ```bash
   0 * * * * /path/to/your/zwfm-audiologger/audiologger.sh
   ```

## Debugging

To enable debug mode, set `DEBUG=1` in the script. This will output debug information to the console to help identify any issues during execution.
